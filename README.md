**System Overview:**

**The Book Inventory Management System** is composed of two fundamental components: a Python script and an XML file. The Python script acts as the user interface, enabling users to interact with the system, view book records, and update borrowing information. The XML file functions as the database, housing and organizing the book and borrowing records in a structured format.

**XML Data Structure:**
The XML file, designated as "book.xml," adheres to a well-structured hierarchy for storing book-related information. Each <book> element represents an individual book and contains child elements for various attributes, including:        
    • <category>: Book Category        
    • <title>: Book Title        
    • <author>: Book Author(s)        
    • <year>: Publication Year        
    • <price>: Book Price        
    • <borrower>: Borrower's Name        
    • <issuedDate>: Issued Date        
    • <returnDate>: Return Date        
    
This structured approach facilitates efficient data organization and retrieval, ensuring that both book and borrowing records are well-maintained.
System Features:
**    1. Listing Books:**
        ◦ The system allows users to list all available books.
        ◦ The Python script parses the "book.xml" file using the ElementTree library and displays book details in a tabular format.  
    **2. Updating Book Information:**
        ◦ Users can update book data, including title, author(s), category, publication year, and price.
        ◦ The Python script facilitates the modification of book information, and changes are instantly reflected in the XML file to maintain data accuracy.    
**    3. Borrowing and Returning Books:
**        ◦ The system incorporates the ability to borrow and return books.
        ◦ Users are prompted to specify the borrower's name, issued date, and return date for each book.
        ◦ Borrower information and dates are stored in the XML file, allowing for efficient book tracking and management.
**    4. Data Persistence:
**        ◦ Book data and borrowing records are persistently stored in the "book.xml" file.
        ◦ All changes made to the book inventory, such as updates and borrowing actions, are saved in the XML file, ensuring data durability.
        
**Usage:
**The Book Inventory Management System streamlines the organization and management of a library's book collection, with a particular emphasis on tracking borrowing records. It empowers users to effectively view, update, borrow, and return books while preserving the integrity of book and borrowing data through XML-based storage. The system provides a user-friendly and structured approach to book management, making it an invaluable tool for library administrators and users alike.

**Conclusion:
**The Book Inventory Management System with borrowing records introduces an efficient and structured approach to library book management. By leveraging Python and XML, the system ensures the seamless organization and retrieval of both book and borrowing data. It not only simplifies library operations but also enhances user experiences by providing real-time book availability and borrowing information. This system can serve as a valuable asset for libraries and institutions aiming to improve their book management and user services.
